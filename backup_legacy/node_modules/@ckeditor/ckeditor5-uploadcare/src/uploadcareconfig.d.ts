 * The minimal configuration for the Uploadcare feature requires providing the
 * {@link module:uploadcare/uploadcareconfig~UploadcareConfig#pubkey `config.uploadcare.pubkey`}:
 *
 * ```ts
 * ClassicEditor
 *  .create( editorElement, {
 *      uploadcare: {
 *          pubkey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
 *      }
 *  } )
 *  .then( ... )
 *  .catch( ... );
 * ```
 *
 * However, you can also adjust the feature to fit your needs:
 *
 * ```ts
 * ClassicEditor
 *  .create( editorElement, {
 *      uploadcare: {
 *      	uploader: {
 *          	sourceList: [
 *              	'local',

 *              	'gdrive'
 *          	],
 *          },
 *          pubkey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
 *      }
 *  } )
 *  .then( ... )
 *  .catch( ... );
